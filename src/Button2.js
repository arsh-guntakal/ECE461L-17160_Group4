// In React, a component's "state" is an object that stores data specific to 
// that component. 
// This data can change over time and can be used to render dynamic content 
// in the component. 
// The component's state is considered to be its "single source of truth".
// This is an example of a simple component with state.
// Click button that shows how many times it has been clicked.
